## What I Learned

This project was a practical exercise in:

* Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML.
* Using **Flexbox** to create complex layouts, including centering elements, creating rows/columns, and managing spacing.
* Implementing a design from scratch without step-by-step instructions.
* Styling elements with CSS, including fonts, colors, and margins/padding.
